# Laws and Theorems - Minecraft Forge Mod

## A Minecraft mod which is filled with math and science concepts to make players feel "Oh my god I've learned so much by playing this mod".

This project is made when I'm freshman in college. Most of the time we are learning theorems of the perfect world. While this is boring but its a must go path to master a subject. This is what this mod is build for.

* Create a Minecraft mod which needs Forge Mod Loader to run it.
* Dump every STEM concepts into the mod because I'm bored.
* Doesn't care how fun it is.
* Performance Optimize? If there is major performance issue, send an issue to me or make a pull request, or I'll just focus on readabiity.

## How do I add it to minecraft?

Select a release at the right of the github repo. Download the jar file (ignore the source codes) and do the same thing as other mods do.

## Check the development videos I made.

## Is there a wiki page for this
YES! check it out at https://laws-and-theorems.fandom.com/wiki/Laws_and_Theorems_Wiki. We need someone to contribute to it.

## I'm interested in this project. I want to contribute (add randomness) to this project.

Sure :), first fork this project to your own github. Second, clone it to your local computer. Lastly, open with VScode (IDK will IntellijIDEA and Eclipse work because I have run genVSCodeRun gradle task), and you're off to go. After you have finished, make a pull request and i'll choose to deny it or not :D.

Oh remember to download jdk 17, not 8. Minecraft runs in java 17.
If the IDE starts yelling random error messages, cancel what it is doing and type 
```
./gradlew genVSCodeRun
```
if you are using Mac/Linux
or 
```
"gradlew genVSCodeRun" 
```
if you are using Windows in your command prompt.

## AHH There is bugs inside!

Help me! fork it and send a pull request after you have finished.

## What are you working right now?

Maybe I'm study for the test tomorrow. Just wait, please.
Also, this is a secret. Even I'm building something right now, I won't tell you about it.
